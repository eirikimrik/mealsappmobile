# Meals application

Got the starting point from a udemy course, similar to the course for flutter.
We had some issues getting started from this template, because it was so outdated. So it took us a few hours to get it
running without errors.

### Extra features

We implemented a "get random meal" button, that gives the user a random meal from the data list.

We also implemented the favorites screen and the favorites logic, so the user can click the star above meals to add
it to their favorites list.
