# Meals App Assignment IDATA2503

### Overview

This is a simple meals application built with React Native as part of the IDATA2503 assignment. The app allows users to
browse through categories of meals, view details of the meals, and save their favorite for easy access. We also added a
"Get a Random Meal" feature for users looking for meal inspiration.

We got the starting point/template from a Udemy course, similar to the course for Flutter.
However, we had some issues getting started from this template, because it was so outdated.
So it took us a few hours to get it running without errors.

### Working in group

In this assignment we worked together in groups of two, like last assignment. Since we didn't build the app from scrath
this time, we focused on fixing the provided template and adding new features to the application. Once the base app was
running, we collaboratively implemented the additional features, like the random meal functionality and the favorites
system.

### Features

- Browse catories: Users can browse though different meal categories
- Meal overview: Users can view meals within each category
